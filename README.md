**30th Oct 2016: Looking for someone to take ownership of the project**

I clearly no longer have the time to properly manage/curate this project.  Rather than letting it die and move to a new fork I am looking for someone to take ownership of this GitHub project and the related web page.  

If you are interested please email jsgantt.improved@gmail.com responses will likely be slow.

A fully featured gantt chart component built entirely in Javascript, CSS and AJAX. No images required.

You can view a live example at http://jsganttimproved.x10host.com/

Features include:
  * Tasks & Collapsible Task Groups
  * Dependencies
  * Task Completion
  * Task Styling
  * Milestones
  * Resources
  * Dynamic Loading of Tasks
  * Dynamic change of format (hour/day/week/month/quarter)
  * Load Gantt from XML
    * From external files (including experimental support for MS Project XML files)
    * From JavaScript Strings
  * Support for Internationalisation (all hard coded strings can be overridden)

Project forked as I was unable to contact the original maintainers.  This work was done to support a personal project that didn't warrant a more heavyweight system (e.g. the dojo toolkit gantt chart features).

See the [Documentation](https://github.com/jsGanttImproved/jsgantt-improved/wiki/Documentation) wiki page or the included ``index.html`` file for instructions on use.

Latest Release: v1.7.5.2 - Honour standard group task start and end dates
